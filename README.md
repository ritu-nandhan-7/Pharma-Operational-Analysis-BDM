## Description
# Pharma-Operational-Analysis-BDM
Data-driven operational analysis project done as part of the Business Data Management Capstone under the IITM Online BS Program. This project involved identifying bottlenecks in packaging and raw material handling at a pharmaceutical company and suggesting improvements based on primary manufacturing data.

# Pharma Operational Analysis – BDM Capstone Project

This repository presents the final deliverables of my **Business Data Management (BDM) Capstone Project** under the **IITM Online BS Program**. I worked individually with **Carewell Steuart Pharma Pvt Ltd**, a medium-scale pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Tamil Nadu.

## 📌 Project Summary

The project focused on identifying inefficiencies in:

- Post-packaging dispatch delays
- Packaging material consumption
- Raw material usage post-QA approval
- Yield loss and compression inefficiencies

Using manually digitized data from **Batch Manufacturing Records (BMRs)**, I analyzed 11 batches of *Frusemide Tablets IP 40 mg*. The key focus areas were:

- Reducing storage delays post-packaging
- Improving inventory planning
- Monitoring compression loss
- Streamlining material handling workflows

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Data collection & cleaning from primary records
- Descriptive analytics using Excel
- Visual analysis using Python
- Operational pattern recognition
- Business problem framing & reporting

## 🚫 Data Privacy Notice
